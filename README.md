# Data structure and algorithm design
This repository is the storage location for homework and learning materials for data structure and algorithm design courses. 
The name of each folder indicates the content of the topic, and there are two pdf files in each folder, one of which is the topic, and the other is the answer I wrote. My pdf file is generated by the latex program, you can download and run the tex file in each folder to modify the generated pdf file.
The main content of the data structure and algorithm course includes: asymptotic notation, recurrences, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, elementary data structures, heaps, hash tables, binary search trees, sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, NP-Completeness.
Some of these algorithms have been implemented in python, you can download the py files and use python3.6 or higher to run these programs.
